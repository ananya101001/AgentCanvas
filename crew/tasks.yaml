    Analyze this user request: "{user_prompt}"
    Design a complete landing page wireframe with compelling marketing copy.
    You MUST return a valid JSON object matching the WireframeAndCopy schema exactly.
    Choose a color_theme that fits the brand (e.g. rose, blue, green, purple, amber).
  expected_output: >
    A valid JSON object with keys: brand_name, color_theme, hero (headline,
    subheadline, cta_button_text), features (list of 3 with title and description),
    testimonial_quote, testimonial_author.

    You are given a wireframe JSON object with all the real content already filled in.
    Your job is to write a complete HTML page using ONLY the actual values from the JSON.
    
    Here is the wireframe data: {wireframe_and_copy}
    
    QA feedback to fix (if any): {qa_feedback}
    
    CRITICAL RULES:
    - DO NOT use any template syntax like {{{{ }}}} or {{% %}}
    - DO NOT use placeholder variable names like brand_name or hero.headline
    - EXTRACT the actual text values from the JSON and hardcode them directly into the HTML
    - For example if brand_name is "NeuralDesk", write NeuralDesk directly in the HTML
    - If headline is "AI Support Tool", write that exact text in the HTML
    - Use Tailwind CSS CDN for styling
    - Sections in order: Hero, Features (3 cards), Testimonial, Footer
    - Must be fully responsive using Tailwind md: and lg: prefixes
    - Output ONLY raw HTML starting with <!DOCTYPE html>. Nothing else.
  expected_output: >
    A complete valid HTML5 document with all real content hardcoded directly.
    No placeholders, no template syntax, no variable names visible anywhere.
    Starts with <!DOCTYPE html> and nothing else before it.
qa_task:
  description: >
    Review this HTML code carefully: "{raw_code}"
    Check for:
    1. Missing or unclosed HTML tags
    2. Invalid or misspelled Tailwind CSS classes
    3. Missing Tailwind CDN script in the head
    4. Poor mobile responsiveness (missing responsive classes)
    5. Missing sections (Hero, Features, Testimonial, Footer)
    If everything is correct, output exactly: PASS
    If there are issues, output a numbered list of specific bugs only.
  expected_output: >
    Either the single word PASS, or a numbered list of bugs to fix.
